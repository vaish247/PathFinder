# PathFinder
The images and text below describe how the program works

!["Intial game state"](https://github.com/vaish247/pathFinder2/blob/main/Initial%20game%20state.png?raw=true)
The image above shows the initial state of the game. It consists of a game board made out of tiles and 4 control buttons.
!["Adding walls"](https://github.com/vaish247/pathFinder2/blob/main/Adding%20Walls.png?raw=true)
The image above shows that the user added wall tiles to the game. This is done by clicking on the grey "Wall Tile" button. 
Then the user clicks on one of the game tiles. This will turn the game tile into a grey wall tile. If the user drags their mouse around the game board
the user can automatically turn other game tiles into a wall tile. The user can stop this by clicking on one of the game tiles.
!["Adding targets"](https://github.com/vaish247/pathFinder2/blob/main/Adding%20target%20tiles.png?raw=true)
The image above shows that the user added 2 "target" tiles to the game. This is done by clicking on the green "selected tile"
button.Then the user can click on 2 game tiles on the game board. If the game tile turns green, you have perform this operation correctly.
!["Finding path"](https://github.com/vaish247/pathFinder2/blob/main/Finding%20path.png?raw=true)
When the user has selected 2 green tiles, the user can click on the blue button "Path Find". This will find the path between 2 tiles, which is shown as blue tiles. However the path will not be able to pass through the wall tiles.

The final button is the reset button which resets the state of the game.
